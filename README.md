# Internet-Speed-Test-Twitter-bot

This project uses Selenium to create a bot that:

-Uses an online speed test to check your current internet speed

-If the download speed is lower than what you are being promised by your operator

-Then the bot logs in to your Twitter account and creates a post that calls for your internet provider and asks them why your speed is so low
